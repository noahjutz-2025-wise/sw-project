# ðŸ‘‹ Hi Team

This Git Repository will serve as a central hub for collaborating on our project for Softwareentwicklung (SW).

- We'll coordinate our responsibilities in the Product Backlog. I've set up a [document on CryptPad](https://cryptpad.fr/sheet/#/2/sheet/view/w9rsGPIjlMg1VfyyiRDTA0UcjcNywEH3Pl8vLufCzbI/) that we can all edit. This will be the PDF part of our submission.
- This repository contains the Spring Boot source code and user/admin manual. It will be the ZIP part of our submission.
- We'll have to present our app. Maybe someone else can take the initiative on this.

## First steps

- [ ] Come up with a product
- [ ] Create a lean canvas
- [ ] Define features (F)
- [ ] Define initial product backlog items
- [ ] Define initial user stories (US)
- [ ] Prioritize USs (Must, Should, Could, Won't)
- [ ] Plan the roadmap
